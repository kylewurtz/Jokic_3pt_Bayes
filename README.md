# Jokic_3pt_Bayes

This project contains a Bayesian analysis of Nikola Jokic's three point shooting. It aims to help us better estimate his true three point percentage given that his first two years in the league had dramatically different results. This analysis follows and was inspired by David Robinson's "Introduction to Empirical Bayes".
